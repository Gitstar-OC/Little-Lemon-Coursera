## About the Project
- The Capstone project at the center of this course is based on a scenario involving the restaurant Little Lemon. In particular, the owners of Little Lemon have received negative feedback on the reserve a table function on the Little Lemon website. Users are confused about how to use it and unhappy with how it looks and functions. You have to build a responsive web app and demonstrate multiple skills by coding a modern front end application that allows users to reserve a table for the Little Lemon restaurant.
