## About the Project
- The Capstone project at the center of this course is based on a scenario involving the restaurant Little Lemon. In particular, the owners of Little Lemon have received negative feedback on the reserve a table function on the Little Lemon website. Users are confused about how to use it and unhappy with how it looks and functions. You have to build a responsive web app and demonstrate multiple skills by coding a modern front end application that allows users to reserve a table for the Little Lemon restaurant.

## Metadata cheat sheet!

### #HTML <meta> tags 

- ####  Name 
The name of the property can be anything you like, although browsers usually expect a value they understand and can take an action upon. An example would be <meta name="author" content="name"> to state the author of the page. 

- ####  Content 
The content field specifies the property's value. For example, you can use <meta name="language" content="english">, to specify the language of the webpage to search engines. 

- #### Charset 
The charset is a special field that lets you specify the character encoding used for the page so that the browser can display it properly. The most frequently used is utf-8, and you would add it to your HTML header as follows: <meta charset="UTF-8">  

- #### HTTP-equiv 
This field stands for HTTP equivalent, and it’s used to simulate HTTP response headers. This is rare to see, and it’s recommended to use HTTP headers over HTML http-equiv meta tags. For example, the next tag would instruct the browser to refresh the page every 30 minutes: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"> 

### #Basic meta tags (meta tags For SEO) 
#### `<meta name="description"/>` provides a brief description of the web page 

#### `<meta name=”title”/>` specifies the title of the web page 

#### `<meta name="author" content="name">` specifies the author of the web page  

#### `<meta name="language" content="english">` specifies the language of the web page 

#### `<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />` tells search engines how to crawl or index a certain page 

#### `<meta name="google"/>` tells Google not to show the sitelinks search box for your page when showing search results 

#### `<meta name="googlebot" content=”notranslate” />` tells Google you don’t want to provide an automatic translation for your page if the user uses a different language  

#### `<meta name="revised" content="Sunday, July 18th, 2010, 5:15 pm" />` specifies the last modified date and time on which you have made certain changes 

#### `<meta name="rating" content="safe for kids">` specifies the expected audience for your page 

#### `<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2022">` specifies a Copyright 


### #meta http-equiv="..." tags
#### `<mta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html">` specifies the format of the document returned by the server 

#### `<meta http-equiv="default-style"/>`  specifies the format of the styling document 

#### `<meta http-equiv="refresh"/>` specifies the duration of the page before it’s considered stale 

#### `<meta http-equiv=”Content-language”/>` specifies the language of the page 

#### `<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache">` instructs the browser how to cache your page 

### #Responsive design/mobile meta tags 
#### `<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=yes"/>` indicates that telephone numbers should appear as hypertext links that can be clicked to make a phone call 

#### `<meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="true"/>` specifies that the page can be properly visualized on mobile devices 

#### `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>` specifies the area of the window in which web content can be seen
