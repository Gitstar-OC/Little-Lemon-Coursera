# Little Lemon Coursera
- This is the my code for the final week of  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/meta-front-end-developer-capstone?specialization=meta-front-end-developer"> Front-End Developer Capstone Course </a> by Meta which is a part of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/CP2NHQXCUXGL"> Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate</a> 

## About the Project
- The Capstone project at the center of this course is based on a scenario involving the restaurant Little Lemon. In particular, the owners of Little Lemon have received negative feedback on the reserve a table function on the Little Lemon website. Users are confused about how to use it and unhappy with how it looks and functions. You have to build a responsive web app and demonstrate multiple skills by coding a modern front end application that allows users to reserve a table for the Little Lemon restaurant.
